1. Hours to complete the project: 7 hours

2. Provide a short description of how you approached each problem, issues you 
   encountered, and how you resolved those issues.

   Problem 1 (Particle Identification): I could understand most of the
       contents from this problem, and as I went to the SI session, I could
       also do the coding. But I faced a lot of errors, first one was I was
       adding the self._x and self._P + i instead of multiplying to calculate
       the distance. On the other hand I got syntex error when I wrote
       pic.width and pic.height because I didn't include the parenthesis after
       that.

   Problem 2 (Particle Tracking): I made some little mistakes like syntex
       errors while writing the writef function, my SI tutor helped me to find
       the problem, other than that I could do the coding easily.

   Problem 3 (Data Analysis): This was straight forward, the checklist was
       very helpful.

3. Did you receive help from anyone? List their names, status (classmate, 
   CS110 grad, TA, other), and the nature of help received.

4. List any other comments here. Feel free to provide any feedback on how
   much you learned from doing the assignment, and whether you enjoyed
   doing it.

   Getting the errors and figuring the solution was very fraustrating, but it
   taught me to be careful about the syntax errors.
